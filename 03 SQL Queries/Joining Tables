Here are a few SQL queries for joining tables 

1. Finding the top 10 countries for Rockbuster in terms of customer numbers.

SELECT D.country, COUNT(A.customer_id)
AS Total_number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY count (A.customer_id) DESC LIMIT 10

2. Finding the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries identified in the above step. 

SELECT C.city, D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS Total_number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States','Japan',
'Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia' ) GROUP BY C.city, D.country
ORDER BY count (A.customer_id) DESC LIMIT 10
